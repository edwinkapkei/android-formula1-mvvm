As a big fan of Formula1 I decided to build an app with basic information about the sport while utilising the clean architecture principles recommended by Google. The purpose of this project is to help me get a deeper understanding to to approaches of clean architecture. The app is written in Kotlin.

This app uses the Ergast Motor Racing API (https://ergast.com/) for information on races, drivers and teams. A big thank you to Ergast developers for providing the data.

The app also borrows from the BoxBox Formula1 app (https://github.com/BrightDV/BoxBox) so a big thank you to the developers.

Currently the app has three screens:
- Race schedule
- Drivers on the grid
- Teams/Constructors

The project is under development and I will be adding new features and making improvements to the UI
